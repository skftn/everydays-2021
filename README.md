# Everyday Code Initiative

*Organized by @cryptopatrick; Inspired by the great Artist [Beeple](https://www.beeple-crap.com/)*

## Everyday?
The focus of this is developer craftmanship. We do this by emulating the artist who sits down for a few hours to create a 'daily piece of art'. We hope that coding everyday will improve both speed of development and ability to gauge realistic program scope.

There are only three rules. The Everyday has to be:

1. Created from start to finish in the same day
2. Posted online before midnight, on the same day that it was created
3. Posted online where other people can access it (GitHub, Instagram, etc)

This is the Remix:
To speed up the process it's okay to remix/remake earlier Everydays.
But each new Everyday should be a standalone piece of code.
